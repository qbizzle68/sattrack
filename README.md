# Sattrack

The sattrack package allows for astrodynamic computations of satellite motion around celestial
bodies. 

## Install

Currently, sattrack is not uploaded on pypi or any other package publishing site. To install
the package you will need to download the [source](https://www.github.com/qbizzle68/sattrack)
code from github and install the package into your python environment. The package source can
be downloaded by running
``` bash
git clone https://www.github.com/qbizzle68/sattrack.git
```
and installed by running
``` python
pip install <path-to-sattrack>
```
The <path-to-sattrack> must be the main directory of the sattrack repository which contains the
setup.py file.

## Usage

The bare necessities for dealing with astrodynamics are satellites, celestial bodies and time.
