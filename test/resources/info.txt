The SGP4 files have been modified for this project. In 'tcppver.out', some test which time
ranges don't start with zero had the leading zero time vector data removed. Also, the time
info listed after the second line of each TLE in SGP4-VER.TLE are not all accurate, and have
been modified. The only inaccuracies seem to be the end time of ranges.
